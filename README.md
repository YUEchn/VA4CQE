### introduction
VA4CQE is a visual analytics system for software project quality evolution.

![Example Image](/VA4CQE.png)

The system contains three parts. One is the project feature overview view, quality evolution view and file issues view; the second is the top tags view and version radar tree view in non-comparison mode; and the third is the tags comparison view, version differences view, list of added issues and version comparison radar tree view in comparison mode.

The system provides a macro overview of the project's development process, analysing its evolutionary characteristics and identifying important time points in the development process; it also explores individual releases in detail, capturing important information within the release.
